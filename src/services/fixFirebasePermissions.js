===== FIX FIREBASE PERMISSIONS =====

1. FIREBASE SECURITY RULES
   - Make sure you've deployed the security rules from 'firestore.rules'
   - Run: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

2. AUTHENTICATION CHECK
   - Verify you're properly authenticated before accessing Firestore
   - Check that auth state is properly initialized before database calls
   - Add this code before any database access:
     
     if (!auth.currentUser) {
       console.error("User not authenticated");
       return;
     }

3. FIRESTORE DATABASE INITIALIZATION
   - Check the collection/document paths are correct
   - Verify your Firebase project configuration in .env.local

4. FIX THE FIREBASE CONFIG LOCALLY
   - Create a .env.local file in the root of your project with these values:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

5. RESTART YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER
   - Stop and restart your Next.js development server
   - Run: npm run dev

// The specific issue you're facing is likely that the user is not properly 
// authenticated when trying to access Firestore, or your security rules 
// are too restrictive.
